\section{Abelian Categories}


    \begin{definition}\label{def:abelian_category}
        Let \(\bfA\) be a category.
        We say that \(\bfA\) is an \emph{abelian category} if it satisfies the following conditions:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item For any two objects \(A, B \in \Obj(\bfA)\), the hom-set \(\Hom_{\bfA}(A, B)\) is an abelian group, and the composition of morphisms is bilinear.
            \item \(\bfA\) has a zero object, i.e., an object that is both initial and terminal.
            \item \(\bfA\) has all binary products and coproducts.
            \item Every morphism in \(\bfA\) has a kernel and a cokernel.
            \item Every monomorphism in \(\bfA\) is a kernel of some morphism, and every epimorphism in \(\bfA\) is a cokernel of some morphism.
        \end{enumerate}
        \Yang{To be checked.}
    \end{definition}
